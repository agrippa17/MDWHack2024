## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a machine learning model capable of identifying four emotions in tweets:
- ðŸ˜¡ **Anger**
- ðŸ˜ƒ **Joy**
- ðŸ˜¢ **Sadness**
- ðŸ˜Š **Optimism**

The task was to build a classifier that assigns one dominant emotion to each tweet based on the provided dataset.
